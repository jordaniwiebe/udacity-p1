## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

This project uses the 2020 Stack Overflow survey results, whose files are too large to be uploaded to github.  Recommend downloading the survey results csv and pointing the initial dataframe read to your (local) csv.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the most recent Stack Overflow survey data (2020) to understand:

1. Does gender contribute to salary?  Does that change from country to country?
2. Does race/ethnicity contribute to salary?  Does that change from country to country?
3. How many higher education researchers are in the field, and how do their salaries and job satisfaction compare to the average?
4. Is working overtime correlated to job satsifaction?

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main results of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).
